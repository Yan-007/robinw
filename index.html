        <h2>Philosophy & values</h2>
        <p>
          I think everyone wants the same thing - relationship with humanity,

          to grasp these things with my values: authenticity, creativity, &
          hospitality.

      <h2>Visual Design</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>Motion Design</h2>
      <p>
        I started my design journey with motion design in my college days.
        Motion is something that really fascinates me because of the flexibility
        of story telling.

      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>
        Clicking pictures really brings out the creative in me. Phtography
        really makes you look and percieve things in a different way.
